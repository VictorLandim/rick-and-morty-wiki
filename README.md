# Rick and Morty Wiki 🧪💥

This project is a Rick and Morty Wiki. The application consists of a listing of all the series' characters as well as a details page for each one of them. The app also consumes the fantastic [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql).

It is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
